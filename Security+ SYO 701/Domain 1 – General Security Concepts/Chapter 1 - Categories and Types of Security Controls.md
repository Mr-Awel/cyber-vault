#### **Control Categories**
---
The **four** main control categories are **technical**, **managerial**, **operational**, and **physical**. Each category represents a different aspect of control within an organization and is crucial for ensuring efficiency, effectiveness, and compliance. Each of these categories is explained in the following sections.

-**Technical Controls** primary focus is upholding system integrity, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, and protecting sensitive data from threats. Examples of technical controls are as follows: 
    -**Firewalls**: They are common technical control used to protect computer networks from unauthorized access by monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic; they filter and block potential threats and reduce the risk  of unauthorized intrusion. 
    -**Data encryption**: It is a technical control that converts sensitive information into a coded form, making it unreadable to unauthorized individuals.

-**Managerial Controls** encompass the implementation of policies, procedures, and practices by the management to guide and direct the activities of individuals and teams so the people are aligned with the organizations goals. Examples of Managerial Controls are as follows:
    -**Performance reviews**: It's a regular assessment of employee performance.
    -**Risk assessment**:  It's a systemic identification, evaluation, and mitigation of potential risks with in an organization.
    -**Code of conduct**: Set of guidelines and ethical standards established by management to govern employee behavior. 

-**Operational Controls** revolve around the execution of day to day activities and processes necessary for delivering goods and services. Examples of operational controls are as follows:
    -**Incident response procedures**: they outline the steps to be followed in the event of a security incident or breach.
    -**Security awareness training**: Educates employees about security threats, best practices, and organizational policies. 
    -**User access management**: management and control of user access privileges to systems, applications, and data.

-**Physical Controls** primary focus is on the protection of an organization's tangible assets, facilities, and resources. Examples of Physical Controls are as follows:
    -**Access control vestibule**: It is a small enclosed area with two doors that creates a buffer zone between the outside environment and the secured area; It typically requires individuals to pass through multiple authentication steps(such as presenting an access card or undergoing biometric verification) before they proceed into a secured area.
    -**Biometric locks**: Utilizes unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial recognition, to grant access. 
    -**Guards/security personnel**: personals generally stationed at entry points that are responsible for monitoring surveillance systems, conducting patrols, and enforcing security protocols. 
    -**Close-circuit television(CCTV) surveillance systems**: They utilize cameras to monitor and record activities in specific areas.
    -**Mantraps**: They are enclosed areas that allow only one person at a time to pass through. They typically consist of two interlocking doors or gates. The first door must close and lock before the second door opens, ensuring that only authorized individuals can proceed through the controlled area.
    -**Tamper-evident seals**: Tamper-evident seals are used to secure containers, equipment, or sensitive areas. These seals are designed to show visible signs of tampering or unauthorized access, such as a broken seal or a change in color, indicating that someone has attempted to gain access or tamper with the secured item.

#### **Control Types**
---
Control types are essential components of an effective management system that help organizations achieve their objectives and ensure the smooth operation of processes. The following list defines these control types, providing an example for each:

-**Preventive controls**: Primary focus is on eliminating or minimizing potential threats before they can cause harm. Examples of preventative controls include: Firewall Installations, Employee training programs, Quality checks. 

-**Deterrent controls**: Primary focus is to discourage individuals from engaging in undesirable behaviors or activities by creating a perception of risk or negative consequences. Examples of deterrent controls include: Surveillance cameras, Warning signs, Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication. 

-**Detective controls**: Primary focus is to identify and detect problems or risks that have already occurred. They help uncover issues and anomalies promptly to initiate corrective actions. Examples of detective controls include: Regular financial audits, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

-**Corrective controls**: Primary focus is to address problems or risks after they have been identified. They aim to rectify the situation, mitigate the impact, and restore normalcy.  Examples of corrective controls include: Implementing backup and recovery system.

-**Compensating controls**: They're alternative measures implemented when primary controls are not feasible or sufficient, they help offset the limitations or deficiencies of other controls. Examples of compensating controls include: Requiring additional layers of approval for financial transactions in the absence of automated control systems, Utilizing a secondary authentication method when the primary method fails or is unavailable, and Increasing physical security measures when technical controls are compromised. 

-**Directive controls**: focus is on providing specific instructions or guidelines to ensure compliance with policies, procedures, or regulations, they establish  framework for employees to follow. Examples of directive policies controls include: Code of conduct or Ethical guidelines, **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**. 

The control types work together to establish a comprehensive control environment that safeguards an organization's assets, promotes compliance, and enables effective risk management.
