### Control Categories  
- **Technical Controls**  
  Technology-based measures to protect systems and data by minimizing vulnerabilities and unauthorized access.  
  *Example:* A firewall that filters incoming/outgoing traffic; data encryption that renders intercepted data unreadable.

- **Managerial Controls**  
  Policies, procedures and oversight implemented by management to guide activities, align employees with objectives, and reduce organizational risk.  
  *Example:* Regular risk assessments and a formal code of conduct.

- **Operational Controls**  
  Day-to-day processes and staff-driven procedures that enforce security and efficiency in business operations.  
  *Example:* Incident response playbooks and recurring security-awareness training.

- **Physical Controls**  
  Tangible safeguards that prevent unauthorized physical access to facilities and assets.  
  *Example:* Biometric door locks, perimeter fences, CCTV cameras.

### Control Types  
- **Preventive Controls**  
  Stop incidents before they happen by eliminating or reducing vulnerabilities.  
  *Example:* Installing and properly configuring firewalls. 

- **Deterrent Controls**  
  Discourage malicious behavior by signaling that damaging actions will have consequences.  
  *Example:* Visible CCTV cameras and warning signs.

- **Detective Controls**  
  Identify and uncover incidents after they occur.  
  *Example:* SIEM systems that aggregate logs and flag anomalies.

- **Corrective Controls**  
  Mitigate the impact of incidents and restore systems to normal operation.  
  *Example:* Backup-and-restore procedures for compromised data. 

- **Compensating Controls**  
  Provide alternative safeguards when primary controls aren’t feasible.  
  *Example:* Manual managerial approvals when an automated control is unavailable.

- **Directive Controls**  
  Issue instructions or guidelines to ensure compliance with policies and regulations.  
  *Example:* Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and published ethical guidelines.
