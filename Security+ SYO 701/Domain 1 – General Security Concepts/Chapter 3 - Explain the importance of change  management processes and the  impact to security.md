### 🎯 **Exam Objective 1.3**

Explain the importance of change-management processes **and** their security impact:

- Business-process pillars (Approval → SOP)
    
- Technical implications (allow/deny lists, downtime, legacy apps, dependencies)
    
- Documentation & version control

### 🏗️ **Business-Process Pillars**

| Pillar                                 | What It Does                                                                        | Security Value                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Approval Process**                   | Gets the green-light from CAB(Change Advisory Board) & execs before any work starts | Blocks rogue “cowboy” changes            |
| **Ownership**                          | Names **one** accountable person (CISO, PM, etc.)                                   | Pinpoints responsibility during audits   |
| **Stakeholders**                       | Involve everyone who wins/loses from the change                                     | Early buy-in prevents shadow-IT          |
| **Impact Analysis**                    | Predicts blast-radius—systems, data, users                                          | Surfaces risks **before** go-live        |
| **Test Results**                       | Sandbox proof that the change behaves & is secure                                   | Catches misconfigs, malware, regressions |
| **Backout Plan**                       | Clean rollback path if things break                                                 | Limits dwell-time of new vulns           |
| **Maintenance Window**                 | Low-traffic slot to deploy                                                          | Minimizes user & attacker opportunity    |
| **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** | Step-by-step “flight checklist”                                                     | Consistency = fewer human errors         |

### 🛠️ **Technical Implications**

| Item                      | Why It Matters                                    | Quick Mitigation               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Allow/White-lists**     | Only approved apps/hosts run                      | AppLocker, firewall rules      |
| **Deny/Block-lists**      | Explicitly forbid known-bad items                 | Centralized reputation feeds   |
| **Restricted Activities** | Stops risky user actions (sideloading, reg-edits) | GPO / MDM lockdown             |
| **Downtime**              | Lost revenue & security blind-spots               | Redundant systems + BCP        |
| **Service Restart**       | Controls offline → gaps attackers exploit         | Staggered restarts, monitoring |
| **Application Restart**   | Data corruption & unpatched state                 | Graceful shutdown scripts      |
| **Legacy Apps**           | Outdated, unsupported, vulnerable                 | Isolate, virtualize, retire    |
| **Dependencies**          | One missing service = domino outage               | Dependency maps, health checks |

### 📑 **Documentation & Version Control**

- **Update diagrams** (network, data-flow) as soon as reality changes Chapter 3
    
- **Refresh policies/procedures** so staff don’t follow stale playbooks Chapter 3
    
- **Version-control everything** (configs, scripts, docs) to trace _who_ changed _what_ & _when_ Chapter 3

### ⚡ **Quick-Fire Exam Drills**

|Term|Typical SEQ+ Question|
|---|---|
|Impact Analysis|“Which step forecasts security fallout _before_ a change?”|
|Backout Plan|“What do you use when a patch bricks production?”|
|Maintenance Window|“Why push updates at 02:00?”|
|Dependencies|“App won’t start after service X fails—name the concept.”|
