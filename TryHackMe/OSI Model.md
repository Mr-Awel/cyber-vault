![[OSI Model Diagram.png]]
-The **OSI** model (or **O**pen **S**ystems **I**nterconnection Model) is an essential model used in networking.  This critical model provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.

-**Physical** layer is one of the easiest layers to grasp. Put simply, this layer references the physical components of the hardware used in networking and is the lowest layer that you will find. Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system (1's and 0's).

-**Data link** layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It's the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.

-**Network layer** of the OSI model is where the magic of routing & re-assembly of data takes place (from these small chunks to the larger chunk). The protocols at this layer like **OSPF** (**O**pen **S**hortest **P**ath **F**irst) and **RIP** (**R**outing **I**nformation **P**rotocol) determine the optimal path should take to reach a device.
